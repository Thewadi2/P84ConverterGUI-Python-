# P84converterGUI
Convert p84 to the p20 files from the Yo-kai Watch Games and vice-versa


This is a Script that edits Yo-kai Watch Blasters/Treasure .mtninf/.mtninf2 files to be playable in the Yo-kai Watch normal battles!

---------------------------------------------------------------------

How to use it:

Extract the [CharacterID]_p84 file from your character, open in Kuriimu and extract the mtninf/mtninf2 files to a folder

and click on the "Blasters to Normal Battle" button then select your folder with your mtninfs/mtninf2

After that import your .mtninf files back to your [CharacterID]_p84 file and rename it to [CharacterID]_p20 (or the opposite if you do "Normal battle to blasters")
